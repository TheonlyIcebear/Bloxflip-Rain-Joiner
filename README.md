# Bloxflip-Auto-Rain-Joiner
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Information:
- When there is a rain at [bloxflip](https://bloxflip.com/a/IceBear) this program will notify you about the rain with some information about it
- **Notification and Webhook related code by amprocode**! I coded everything else though (They also made this README.md)
- If you want to use it check license so you know your limits
- If you dont trust it, its literally open source

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation:
1) First download the latest version of the program, either the exe or the python version.
2) Extract the files to a foler of your choice
3) Now run the **"installer.bat"** file and it should start running, now you can minimise the chrome browser and the program and do some work while waiting for a notification. 
- Any problems open up a new issue on this github respitory!

## Config guide:

Default config.json file:
```json
{
	"minimum_amount": 500,
	"webhook_enabled": true,
	"webhook": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
	"webhook_ping": "<@1234567890>",
	"notifications_enabled": true,
	"authorization": ""
}
```
### minimum_amount:
Minimum rain amount intended for the program required to send you a notification. If you dont want this and want to be notified of all rains leave it at 500

Example: If you set it to 1000 it will only notify you of rains that are bigger then or equal to 1000 R$


### notifications_enabled:
If set to "true" then a popup on the bottom right on your screen will display showing you information about the current rain

Here is an example:

### webhook_enabled:
Should be obvious but if you want the rain notifier to send a message to your discord webhook set it to "True"

### webhook_ping:
You can now ping a role or user instead of @everyone. If you need help getting an ID im sure this will help:

Setting up ping:

If you want to ping **@everyone** or **@here** make sure your webhook_ping setting looks something like this:
```
"webhook_ping": "@everyone",
```
If you want to ping a **user** make sure your webhook_ping setting looks something like this:
```
"webhook_ping": "<@747719812054253568>",
```
If you want to ping a **role** just put a **&** symbol infront of the numbers. It should look something like this:
```
"webhook_ping": "<@&690632567663575090>",
```

**Obviously these are examples, replace the numbers with your own**

### webhook:
If you set webhook_enabled to "True" input your webhook into here to it can actually send it to you

Example of webhook:
